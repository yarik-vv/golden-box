## My first job, which was completed in June 2016.
This is responsive, cross-browser SPA (single page application) which uses AngularJS 1.X (2 controllers and 1 service) and Bootstrap, data come from a JSON file by AJAX request.
   
## In February 2017 I did a code review:
* added css modules;
* added views modules;
* added validation and alerts;
* off hover for all touch screens;
* fixed views for tablet in portrait orientations and other screens;
* added new favicon;
* added woff2 and woff icons and fonts;
* structure and optimize all images, combined small images in one file;
* minify all html, js, css code.
